# ExtremumSearch
Find your extreme

Using the technology C# abd WPF and the pattern MVVM, as well as the nuget package LiveCharts and Sprache.Calc for drawing charts, I created this application where you can enter absolutely any function, and my app will find its extremum, if there is one.
Two methods are implemented : Golden Section, Newton
Two more on the way (4 years later???): Tanget, Broken Line
